## Task 

Your mini-app should take user input for

- A category name

- A category icon

- A category colour

- [X] When the user clicks ‘Next’, it should display the recently added category name, icon and colour, with a ‘Back’ button (not designed).

- [X] When the user clicks ‘Back’, the newly created category should now be added to the list and displayed.

- [X] When the user chooses a previously made category and clicks ‘next’, it should display the previously set category name, icon and colour.

- [X] The user is also able to delete the category by hovering over the category and pressing the ‘delete’ (rubbish bin) icon.

The icon selector and colour selector have not been designed. How this looks, works and is developed is entirely up to you; you can using an existing library, HTML API or create your own mini-selector, with emojis. It does not have to be expansive.

It’s recommended you use localStorage or sessionStorage to store the data, however, you could use any database or data store of your choice.

Additional
